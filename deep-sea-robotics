git commit -m "While the deep sea is a field of exploration that is slowly growing, it has a long way to go before reaching the level of understanding humans have on the land and in the sky. The goal of this self-study course is to simulate a robot that can withstand deep sea conditions and possibly navigate it with a localization technique, such as electrolocation, using Gazebo Simulator.

During the semester, Dr. Clark and I will meet weekly on Tuesdays at 11:30 a.m. If more meetings are needed, we will communicate through email.  After this project, I hope to gain more experience in coding and simulating robots. It is also beneficial to my holistic learning and intrigues me."
