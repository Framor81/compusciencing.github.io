# Adding a post

Here are instructions for [How to write a post](https://compusciencing.github.io/how-to-write-a-post.html) for this blog. Anyone is allowed to write a post and submit it via a pull request.

Whenever a pull request is merged into this repository, GitHub Pages will automatically run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the site.

# Features to add

Look at the themes found [here](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/jekyll-theme-showcase-share-your-jekyll-themes/1382/15), [here](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme), and [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes).

This one seems OK: https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll
