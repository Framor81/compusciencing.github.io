As a continuation of last semester's project, the goal of this self-study course is to simulate a robot that can withstand deep sea conditions and independently navigate the waters. Methods of navigation include using localization techniques, such as electrolocation. I will build the project using the Gazebo Simulator and an already altered UUV simulator environment that I started work on last semester.
During the semester, Dr. Clark and I will meet weekly on Fridays at 9:10 AM. If we need additional meetings, we will communicate through email.  Throughout this project, I hope to gain more experience in coding and simulating robots.
