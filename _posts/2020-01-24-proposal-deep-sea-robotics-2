As a continuation of last semester's project, the goal of this self-study course is to simulate a robot that can withstand deep sea conditions and independently navigate the waters. Possible methods of navigation include using localization techniques, such as electrolocation. The project will be built using Gazebo Simulator and an already altered UUV simulator environment (last semester). 
During the semester, Dr. Clark and I will meet weekly on Fridays at 9:10 AM. If more meetings are needed, we will communicate through email.  Throughout this project, I hope to gain more experience in coding and simulating robots.
