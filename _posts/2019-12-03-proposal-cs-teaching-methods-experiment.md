Pedagogy for Computer Science is still a young area of research where many contributions can be made. I would like to conduct research on a multi-sectioned Missouri State University Department of Computer Science course in the Fall 2020 semester. I will use this proposed Spring 2020 CSC696 course to develop a hypothesis and build an experiment for the Fall 2020 semester.

# Project Milestones

* Develop a good hypothesis
    * Does a tactile demonstration for a theoretical computer science concept increase student understanding of the concept? For example, would students better understand a sorting algorithm if they performed each step of the algorithm with a set of playing cards?
* Develop an expirement to test the hypothesis
    * Use 4 sections: 2 test sections and 2 control sections
    * Teach the concept of Turing Machines to all 4 sections
        * The 2 control sections receive a traditional lecture
            * [![Turing Machines Explained - Computerphile](http://img.youtube.com/vi/dNRDvLACg5Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNRDvLACg5Q)
        * The 2 test sections recieve a lecture with a hands-on demonstration
            * [![Turing Tumble](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3r0P3CSYI-U/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r0P3CSYI-U)
    * Test all 4 sections on the same set of Turing Machine questions
        * Use as a set of bonus questions on one of the course exams
* By February 24th, 2020 
    * Submit an application for review to Missouri State University's [Institutional Review Board](https://ora.missouristate.edu/IRB.htm)
* By April 6th, 2020
    * Present the proposed research to the instructors of a multi-sectioned course

# Meetings and Work

Meetings would be held about once a week for the duration of the Spring 2020 semester. In addition to working towards the above project milestones, I would also use the semester to read STEM Pedagogy methods and Computer Science Pedagogy research papers. The hope would be that this research can be repeated in future semesters.
