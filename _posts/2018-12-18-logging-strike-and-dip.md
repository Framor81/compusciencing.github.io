This project dramatically improved my understanding of software development, not only in the software side of science but it pushed me to go beyond the keyboard, into areas of study that I found to be surprisingly interesting: *rocks*! This solidified my confidence in the field of computer science, and also gave me a new understanding of the importance of cross training with other degree fields to find innovative ways to apply current tech in new ways. This project pushed the limits of my ability in several areas from hardware development like Arduino and bread-boarding, while leveraging new-to-me programming languages like [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and C. Also understanding how Bluetooth communication and serial communication work, and implementing these concepts with multiple out-of-the-box tools, programming languages, and libraries working in unison. To using a mobile application framework like [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) to help speed up the development of the smart phone application side of the project. 

Flutter is a framework that helps by simplifying code using Dart prepackaged code modules called Widgets that are templates to build features such as buttons or easy layout designs for the smart phone application that is needed to interface with the hardware.

The focus of this project was to create a new piece of technology to replace analog strike and dip tools. This antiquated device used by geologists to gather survey information needed to make predictions of mineral or gas deposits underneath the points being tested. The idea is to create a hardware or device to replace the antiquated analog device being used. Our goal was to create a new electronic version that must interface with a smart phone and must be able to find true north without GPS or a compass (magnetometer). This would ensure more accurate measurements were being recorded and would eliminate the need for a compass to achieve the same or improved results. There are several problems that we encountered in developing this project from start to finish but with some help and a lot of online research one by one we tackled these issues.

The first hurdle this team had to overcome was picking the correct hardware to use in this specific project. This was really headed by Dr. Clark because as the only one with previous experience working with these specific hardware devices his expertise was valuable to make sure we were covering all the possible variables needed in gathering gyroscope and accelerometer data as well as the compatibility of all the hardware.

We first used an older [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) as the main board for the project, but we soon learned that the Arduino board was not as suited as the [Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE - nRF52832](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) because this would eliminate the need for additional Bluetooth hardware. It contained all the hardware as the Arduino but with the added low energy Bluetooth chip that we needed to communicate with the Flutter/Dart application.

For me I wanted to point out that I found it especially difficult to picture the layout or the sequence of the project beforehand without much expertise in either geology, hardware design and implementation or mobile application design. I luckily had some advice given to me from the team members that had some expertise in these areas which helped me overcome these limitations. One thing that I had not used in the past that helped visualize the whole layout of the hardware was helped by the [Fitzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) diagram that Dr. Clark made.

I have never used this software before, but this helped in understanding the project and speeding up the process of soldering the hardware to the breadboard.

The second hurdle was to pick a mobile application framework that would be best suited for this problem. I again lucked out and had a partner Ali that picked up this task with a determination to get it solved. With a few weeks we had a working basic app that had a few basic widgets involved in reading the data and displaying that data on another view we called infinite scrolling widget. One specific problem I would like to point out with the Flutter framework is that if you have a space in your user profile this framework will not run with that profile. It was something that caused me a problem in getting it to work on my computer, so I thought it was worth mentioning. Flutter is a lot like Angular because it takes specific design process you need to adhere to or it will not compile . 

Like I mentioned earlier Flutter framework uses Dart. This can be very helpful when you are familiar with the syntax but can be very frustrating if you only familiar with coding HTML and JavaScript. Still unable to receive data over Bluetooth combination we had to stop with further progress here. The team then turned back to the problem of connecting all the desired hardware. 

Now I would like to move the focus back to working on the hardware side of the project the next thing was to assemble all the specific hardware to get a basic prototype sending data. I found it somewhat easy to connect and solder all the hardware to a breadboard. Ali and I first connected the Adafruit to the board then we added the stepper motor and then the first Gyro. After a lot of set up and backtracking we then found a good design of a combination of the Adafruit and a Gyro that was compatible with all other hardware needed. The libraries with interfaced the Adafruit with the IMU-9250 Gyro were not compatible. Yet, the LSM9DS1 Gyro was compatible with the Adafruit so the team decided it was easier to replace the incompatible Gyro instead of editing the IMU-9250 library to make it compatible. In future designs we have talked about using over one Gyro it would be important for the Team or Team’s working on this project to only use the LSM9DS1 Gyro. After configuring the Arduino IDE to working with the specific Adafruit board, stepper motor and the third Gyro (LSM9DS1) we could use a modified version of the example sketches that came with the configuration it worked. From this point we could power up the device and send all the Gyro data across a serial port #2. We then saved this data using a python program to CSV format to use as testing the accuracy and consistency of the stepper and the gyro.

The third big hurdle was to have hardware modified i.e. the stepper motor. We must have the device rotate 180 degrees one direction back 360 degrees and then forward 180 to the start point. We needed ensure before testing that the motor would stay in a fixed place why we rotated it in the directions needed to gather that data. After this was finished team built, for lack of a better term a large protractor to test the consistency of our motor in repeating this process with little or no errors in rotating the correct degrees and ending at 0 after a thousand rotations. With the testing complete we decided that it would be best for saving processing time and the amount of data on the Adafruit board it would be best to send the minimal amount of data the process true north. Then that data would be sent to the flutter application then we would do the processing to predict truth north.

In the next few weeks the plan is to have this data received via low energy blue tooth to the flutter application. This application is already set up to display this data in a readable format. this will be a good stopping point for the next semesters team to pick up and refine the program we developed. It is hard for me to predict how much or how many more problems they will have to overcome before they have a finished product, but I wish I would be part of seeing it through. This has been a fun project for me to be a part of and I am glad I was given the opportunity to help build something new and innovative like this. The experience I gained from learning new types of hardware and mobile application design was much more than I expected when started this project. I addition this project expanded my knowledge in coding problems for mobile application frameworks like Flutter/Dart and libraries plus other “out of the box” tools I don’t think I would have received from taking classes in these areas. I appreciate how much this project has helped my understanding of how a project like this is developed from start of picking the hardware to the software side of planning through development.

The next team I am sure will pick up with further development of the flutter side of the project. One area I would like to see more improvement with the next team is the layout design of the flutter application. It is in the early development stages of getting the basic data displayed. I am sure there will be a need for more features from calibration settings of the gyro to exporting the data to other software that can provide the customer with a usable form of the data we are getting from this device. I am not sure what features that will need to be added but I assume like in our progress so far envisioning the path of design comes with changes and backtracking. A project like this, making something new and innovative always comes with unexpected problems, finding the design path that works better than its analog counterparts.
