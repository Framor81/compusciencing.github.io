My research can be defined as the development of underwater environments and models using Gazebo Simulator. Specifically, the aim of research was to create a robot/model that could withstand deep sea pressures. However, as the semester went by and technical difficulties arose, my research devolved into more of an exploration of the [UUV simulator](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/) while learning how to use new software and operating systems such as [Gazebo Simulator](http://gazebosim.org/), [Github](https://github.com/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and Linux. Although I did not get as far as I had hoped on my research, I developed an initial prototype to the model and altered the already existing [UUV simulator/environment](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/). 


#SETTING UP
With no previous experience using Gazebo and Linux, a lot of my time in the first few weeks were devoted to downloading and differentiating between Linux Systems. After experimenting with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), both of which are Linux distros, I opted to use Ubuntu which proved much easier to download and run Gazebo. 

#ENVIRONMENT CHANGES/UNDERSTANDING UUV SIMULATOR
After downloading Gazebo, my first step was to create or find a suitable underwater environment. Unlike most other environments, Gazebo did not have a very in-depth default underwater environment, so I decided to use the UUV simulator. The UUV simulator is a "set of packages with Gazebo plugins and ROS modules to enable simulation of underwater vehicles" [(Manh√£es 2018)](https://roscon.ros.org/2018/presentations/ROSCon2018_uuvsimulator.pdf) . After installing the simulator and the proper ROS distributions, I played around with the different provided environments, I settled with using the empty_underwater_world as the base. 

I tested the bouyancy of the simulator by making sure objects sunk when denser.

Going into the research, I knew I wanted to make my focus more about the deep sea. Because of this, I would have to alter the default depth of the simulator. To do this, I expanded the pose and collision of each of the each of the 'walls' of the sea.

#BUILDING INITIAL MODEL
TO create my initial mode, I decided to use Blender. Never having used Blender before, it took me a while to get comfortable with the controls and build 3-D shapes. While deciding what shpae to use, I learned a lot about different types of shapes that are used in manmade underwater vehicles such as submarines, cameras, and more. Some interesting things that I came upon included the pressure.

#GOING FORWARD
Going forwared in this project, several of the issues I want to work on are the robot dealing with and interpreting pressure. It does not seem as if the original simulator has pressure built into it. I also want to work on making the robot more independent.
