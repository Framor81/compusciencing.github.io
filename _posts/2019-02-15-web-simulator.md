Working with Dr. Anthony Clark, I am working on building a web simulator for the Nybble, an open-source robotic kitten. The simulator will be written in TypeScript, using the HyperApp Framework and bundled through Parcel. Furthermore, I will be using the three.js 3D library and the cannon.js physics engine to render the simulation. All of the development is front-end with no server-side scripting, and the website will be hosted on github.io

The simulator will have numerous features - input and update parameters such as arm length for robot, render obstacles in the Nybbleâ€™s path, buttons to start/stop simulation etc. This will be achieved using query parameters, and the aim is to simulate the movements of the Nybble robot with variable body dimensions, and also its ability to maintain its path even if there are numerous obstacles

As previously established with Dr. Clark, we intend to meet every Tuesday at 11:30 AM. In the meeting, we discuss about progress over the week, issues faced, any possible queries, and expectations for the next week.
