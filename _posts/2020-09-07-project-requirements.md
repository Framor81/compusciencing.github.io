I love working with students on research, theses, and independent study projects. For such projects, students:

- come up with their own project plan (or I pay them to work on my project),
- work on the project for a semester (or longer), and
- learn something CS-related while developing a new tool or idea.

These projects are **not** a one-on-one class or tutorial.

I've had students help me design and build robots, design a programming language and build an interpreter, develop a robot path planning algorithm, [create a new markup language for specifying robots](https://compusciencing.github.io/report-arms.html), and [develop a weather simulation](https://compusciencing.github.io/report-ogp-weather-simulation.html). [You can find past projects (starting fall 2018) on this site](https://compusciencing.github.io/).

Getting course credit for a project (rather than getting paid for research) only benefits you if you:

- would rather work on your own project instead of taking a course,
- would not otherwise have time to work on research given your work schedule and course load,
- need partial credit for a CS course (independent study will not count as a full elective),
- are trying to graduate early by taking additional classes, or
- need to add another course and are blocked by prerequisites.

In general, it is more beneficial for students to get paid for working on research.

# Proposal

I require students to write a project proposal ([search "proposal" for examples](https://compusciencing.github.io/)). Proposals must:

- describe a project that can you can complete in a semester (even if you plan on working for multiple terms),
- detail enough work that will take 5 to 10 hours of work per week,
- discuss how the project relates to your academic and/or future career,
- list your goals and a rough time line, and
- [be submitted as a pull-request](https://compusciencing.github.io/how-to-write-a-post.html).

You must complete your proposal before the end of the first week of the semester. Preferably, you will complete your proposal by the end of the previous semester. **Proposals should be roughly 300 to 500 words, and they should include images, diagrams, and/or videos.**

# Updates and Meetings

I meet with students weekly. These meetings can take anywhere from five minutes to one hour, and we can occasionally skip a meeting or add additional meetings as needed.

To prepare for meetings, I require all students to **submit a weekly update the night before we meet**. Updates help me prepare for questions and issues, and they provide you with all the information you'll need for your final report (see the [Report section](#report) below).

For weekly reports, I would like you to use my [GitHub Reports Template](https://github.com/anthonyjclark/reports-template). You can also include a similar file structure inside your main project repository in a directory called "reports"--meaning you don't *have* to clone that repository.

**Please send me a link on Slack to your report the day before we meet.**

# Grade Justification

I require all students completing an independent study project to give me a grade justification at the middle and end of the semester. Justifications are typically 1 to 5 sentences and they must include the letter grade you think you've earned. These short conversations ensure that we are on the same page regarding your effort.

# Report

I require all students to complete a final report at the end of the semester. Final reports should be roughly 500 to 1000 words, and I much prefer it if your post includes images, videos, code snippets, etc. You will also [submit final reports as a pull-request](https://compusciencing.github.io/how-to-write-a-post.html). I like to have final reports submitted before Tuesday of finals week.

Along with the final report, I highly encourage students to present their work to the college. We can discuss details for doing so if you are interested.
